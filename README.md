HooHacks Project: Jared Hood, Luke Deni, Dylan Jenik

Our project calculates what the weather will be like on a road trip from a start to an end destination.

We use the Google Maps API and a weather service API to get both the directions and weather data.

One limitation of this project is that the weather can only be accessed 5 days into the future due to fluctuations so it is only a rough estimate.
